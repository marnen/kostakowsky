    Welcome! This is a Web edition of <cite>International Hebrew Wedding Music</cite>, by Wolff N. Kostakowsky, published in Brooklyn in 1916. A scanned copy of the book is available at [http://aleph.nli.org.il/nnl/dig/books/bk002451648.html](http://aleph.nli.org.il/nnl/dig/books/bk002451648.html).

    The work is an important early collection of klezmer tunes, and has also recently been published in a modern edition as [<cite>The Ultimate Klezmer</cite>][ultimate klezmer]. This website is not related to that edition, but is a completely independent publication of the same source material.

    I have tried to keep this edition as close as possible in content to Kostakowsky’s original. Any editorial additions or comments are in [square brackets].

    Kostakowsky did not consistently use section headings for different types of tunes, but he did number tunes more or less sequentially within what he presumably considered categories. I’ve put each category into its own section below, and the “X:” numbers in the ABC files correspond to Kostakowsky’s tune numbers.

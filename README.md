Source files for Web version of Kostakowsky's _International Hebrew Wedding Music_.

This project contains source files for a forthcoming Web edition of Kostakowsky's [_International Hebrew Wedding Music_](http://www.worldcat.org/title/international-hebrew-wedding-music/oclc/827845229). I'll put more information in this README about how to build the project, but for now I'll note that this project uses the [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) Ruby gem to build the final content, so running `bundle install` and `bundle exec middleman serve` will get you most of the way there. :)
